NGINX

- nginx is a fast, production level HTTP level
- when serving your application with one of the WSGI servers it's good or necessary

performance concerns better than the WSGI server

Installing and running Nginx itself is outside the scope of this tutorial

- this tutorial outlines the basics of configuring NGINX to proxy your application
